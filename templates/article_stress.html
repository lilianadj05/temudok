      <h1>Managing Stress for a Healthier Heart</h1>

      <h2>How Stress Affects the Body</h2>
      <p>
        Stress is a natural response to challenges — but chronic stress can take a toll on your health, especially your heart. When you’re stressed, your body releases hormones like cortisol and adrenaline, increasing your heart rate and blood pressure. Over time, this constant state of alertness can strain the cardiovascular system, leading to hypertension, inflammation, or even heart disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning to manage stress isn’t about avoiding it completely, but developing strategies to reduce its impact on your body and mind.
      </p>

      <h2>Recognizing Stress Signals</h2>
      <p>
        Everyone experiences stress differently. Some people get headaches or muscle tension, while others may feel anxious, irritable, or fatigued. Recognizing your own stress triggers — such as work pressure, financial problems, or relationship conflicts — is the first step in managing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pay attention to both emotional and physical signs: poor sleep, changes in appetite, or a racing heartbeat are often clues that your body is under too much strain.
      </p>

      <h2>Healthy Coping Strategies</h2>
      <p>
        Not all coping mechanisms are equal. While some people turn to unhealthy habits like smoking, overeating, or alcohol to relax, these only worsen long-term health. Instead, choose activities that calm your nervous system. Exercise, deep breathing, meditation, and spending time outdoors can significantly reduce stress hormones.
      </p>
      <p>
        Social support is also essential. Talking with friends, family, or a counselor helps you process emotions instead of bottling them up. Even small breaks during a busy day — stretching, walking, or mindful breathing — can reset your stress levels.
      </p>

      <h2>Nutrition and Rest for a Calm Mind</h2>
      <p>
        A balanced diet and adequate sleep directly influence stress management. Foods rich in magnesium, vitamin B, and omega-3 fatty acids (like leafy greens, nuts, and fish) support brain and heart function. Limiting caffeine and sugar prevents energy crashes that worsen anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Good sleep restores hormonal balance and lowers blood pressure. Aim for 7–9 hours of quality rest each night. Establish a relaxing routine before bed to allow your body to recover from daily stress.
      </p>

      <h2>Choose Balance, Protect Your Heart</h2>
      <p>
        Stress will always be part of life, but your reaction determines its impact. By practicing mindfulness, staying active, and nurturing relationships, you can protect both your emotional well-being and heart health. A calm mind supports a strong heart.
